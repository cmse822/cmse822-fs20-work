Read Chapters 20 and 21 of [Parallel Programming for Science and Engineering](../assets/EijkhoutParallelProgramming.pdf). 

## Review

## Exercises

1. Complete the following exercises and answer the questions posed.
   - 20.1
   - 20.2
  
2. Build the codes to compute the Fibonacci sequence given in Section 21.5.1 and confirm that the results of `taskgroup2.c` are unpredictable without the `depend` statements. Explain why this is. 

## What to turn-in

Commit your code and answers to the exercises as a pdf to your assignment repo _before the start of class_.
